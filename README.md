<h1>Hi there! <br/> My first birthday gift was the name Faris</h1>
	
I am passionate about security, psycholgy and diving head-first into rabbit holes.

I am an engineer by training but love the the field of IT. In my free time I am usually playing CTFs or studying, sometimes both. <br>
I love doing forensics type of work. Theres real art in creating a narrative from little pieces of information.
